# base-names
Rename U.S. Army bases that were named after Confederate generals.
This R Shiny app pulls tables of Union generals from Wikipedia. It then uses the quanteda package to count the number of syllables in all Confederate and Union generals' names.

Click on one of the 10 bases to be renamed and the app will provide you with all Union general names that start with same letter and have the same number of syllables.
